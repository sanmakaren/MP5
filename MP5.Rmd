You will be submiting an entry to Kaggle's [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/){target="_blank"} by fitting a fitted ~~spline~~, ~~multiple regression~~ LASSO regularized multiple regression model $\hat{f}(x)$.

However of the original 1460 rows of the `training` data, in the `data/` folder you are given a `train.csv` consisting of only 50 of the rows!

# Load data

Read in data provided by Kaggle for this competition. They are organized in the `data/` folder of this RStudio project:

```{r}
training <- read_csv("data/train.csv") %>% 
  rename(
    FirstFlrSF = `1stFlrSF`,
    SecondFlrSF = `2ndFlrSF`,
    ThirdSsnPorch = `3SsnPorch`
  ) %>% 
  # Fit your models to this outcome variable:
  mutate(log_SalePrice = log(SalePrice+1))

test <- read_csv("data/test.csv")%>% 
  rename(
    FirstFlrSF = `1stFlrSF`,
    SecondFlrSF = `2ndFlrSF`,
    ThirdSsnPorch = `3SsnPorch`
  )
sample_submission <- read_csv("data/sample_submission.csv")

# Function that takes in a LASSO fit object and returns a "tidy" data frame of
# the beta-hat coefficients for each lambda value used in LASSO fit. 
get_LASSO_coefficients <- function(LASSO_fit){
  beta_hats <- LASSO_fit %>%
    broom::tidy(return_zeros = TRUE) %>%
    select(term, estimate, lambda) %>%
    arrange(desc(lambda))
  return(beta_hats)
}
```


## Look at your data!

Always, ALWAYS, **ALWAYS** start by looking at your raw data. This gives you visual sense of what information you have to help build your predictive models. To get a full description of each variable, read the data dictionary in the `data_description.txt` file in the `data/` folder.

Note that the following code chunk has `eval = FALSE` meaning "don't evaluate this chunk with knitting" because `.Rmd` files won't knit if they include a `View()`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
View(training)
glimpse(training)

View(test)
glimpse(test)

# Pay close attention to the variables and variable types in sample_submission. 
# Your submission must match this exactly.
glimpse(sample_submission)

# Hint:
skim(training)
skim(test)
```

# Minimally viable product

Since we have already performed exploratory data analyses of this data in MP1 and MP2, let's jump straight into the modeling. For this phase:

* Train an unregularized standard multiple regression model $\widehat{f}_1$ using **all** 36 numerical variables as predictors.


```{r}
# Train your model here:

# Model formula
model_formula <- "log_SalePrice ~ MSSubClass + LotFrontage + LotArea + 
OverallQual + OverallCond + YearBuilt + YearRemodAdd + MasVnrArea + BsmtFinSF1 + 
BsmtFinSF2 + BsmtUnfSF + TotalBsmtSF + FirstFlrSF + SecondFlrSF + LowQualFinSF + 
GrLivArea + BsmtFullBath + BsmtHalfBath + FullBath + HalfBath + BedroomAbvGr + 
KitchenAbvGr + TotRmsAbvGrd + Fireplaces + GarageYrBlt + GarageCars + GarageArea + 
WoodDeckSF + OpenPorchSF + EnclosedPorch + ThirdSsnPorch + ScreenPorch + PoolArea + 
MiscVal + MoSold + YrSold" %>% 
  as.formula()

```

# Due diligence

* Compute two RMLSE's of the fitted model $\widehat{f}_1$
      a) on the `training` data. You may use a function from a package to achieve this.
      b) on the `test` data via a submission to Kaggle `data/submit_regression.csv`.
* Compare the two RMLSE's. If they are different, comment on why they might be different.

```{r}
# Compute both RMLSE's here:

```

RMLSE on training  | RMLSE on test (via Kaggle)
------------- | -------------
X             | Y

# Reaching for the stars

1. Find the $\lambda^*$ tuning parameter that yields the LASSO model with the
lowest estimated RMLSE as well as this lowest RMLSE as well. You may use functions included in a package for this.
1. Convince yourself with a visualization that the $\lambda^*$ you found is indeed the one that returns the lowest estimated RMLSE.
1. What is the model $\widehat{f}$_2 resulting from this $\lambda^*$? Output a data frame of the $\widehat{\beta}$.
1. Visualize the progression of $\widehat{\beta}$ for different $\lambda$ values and mark $\lambda^*$ with a vertical line:

```{r}
# Find lambda star:

```

```{r}
# Create visualization here:

```

```{r}
# Output data frame of beta-hats for the LASSO model that uses lambda_star:

```

```{r}
# Visualize the progression of beta-hats for different lambda values and mark lambda_star with a vertical line:

```

# Point of diminishing returns

1. In qualitative language, comment on the resulting amoung of shrinkage in the LASSO model?
1. Obtain the RMLSE of the fitted model
      a) on the `training` data
      b) on the `test` data via a submission to Kaggle `data/submit_LASSO.csv` that we will test.
1. Compare the two RMLSE's. If they are different, comment on why they might be different.

```{r}
# Compute both RMLSE's here:

```

Comparing both RMLSE's here:

LASSO            | A                  | B

# Polishing the cannonball

1. Fit a LASSO model $\widehat{f}_3$ that uses categorical variables as well.
1. Output a `data/submit_LASSO_2.csv`
1. Submit to Kaggle and replace the screenshot below with an screenshot of your score.
